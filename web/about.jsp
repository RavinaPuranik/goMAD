         <br><b>Complaint</b>
<br>Many of us have come across situations, where we could have helped a victim by reporting the witnessed incidence. It is the time when more and more criminal incidences remain unreported because of fear of harassment, social taboos, physical harm etc. By conducting a thorough analysis of current scenario and consultation with police authorities we identified the lacunas that restrict common man to up raise voice.goMAD provides functionality to anonymously report any criminal or illegal activity directly to the police department with crime location and images of the act and description about the same. This functionality does not disclose the identity of the sender and thus, he or she can assure safety. goMAD comes with a convenient way of making a anonymous complaint/report of any incidence. You just need to fill our form and click the'Send' button. It lets you report a crime or any issue in your locality.
